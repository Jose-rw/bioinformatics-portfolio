# About Me

I began my career in electronics, transitioned into biomedical engineering to contribute more directly to health, and developed a strong interest in data science applied to clinical and genomic datasets. Today, I focus on using R, Python, and SAS to perform clinical data analysis and develop bioinformatics workflows.

Iâ€™m passionate about making an impact through data and technology in the healthcare sector.
